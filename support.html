  <p>Welcome to FaithClock Support!</p>

  <h2>About FaithClock</h2>
  <p>FaithClock transforms your device into a beautiful Bible Clock, displaying scripture verses that correspond to the current time alongside photos from your library.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <p><strong>How do I set up photo backgrounds?</strong><br>
  Tap the settings icon (gear) in the top-right corner, then select "Choose Album" to pick a photo album from your library.</p>

  <p><strong>Why do I need to grant photo access?</strong><br>
  FaithClock displays your photos as backgrounds. Your photos stay on your device and are never uploaded or shared.</p>

  <p><strong>How does the verse matching work?</strong><br>
  Bible chapter and verse numbers are mapped to the time. For example, at 3:16, you might see John 3:16. The app includes over 1,500 verses covering every minute of the day.</p>

  <p><strong>Can I change the fonts and text size?</strong><br>
  Yes! Tap the settings icon to customize fonts for the verse text and clock display, as well as text sizes.</p>

  <p><strong>The settings button disappeared. How do I access settings?</strong><br>
  Tap anywhere on the screen. The settings button auto-hides after a few seconds but reappears when you tap.</p>
